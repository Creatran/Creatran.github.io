Objective To test the hypothesis that numeracy is associated with (a) self-reported health, and (b) healthcare-provider visits. Study Design Two survey studies, a random-digit-dial telephone survey in New York State (Empire State Poll), and an international survey on adult education (PIAAC). Study Subjects 800 NYS residents aged over 18 in ESP and 3660 US residents aged over 16 in PIAAC. Study Variables ESP Predictor: numeracy measured by a 3-item version of the Subjective Numeracy Scale (SNS); Outcomes: self-report health status and healthcare-provider visits in the past 12 months. PIAAC Predictor: numeracy proficiency scale including 56 tasks. For both surveys, demographic covariates include gender, age, education, income, race, and ethnicity. Results (a) Weighted multivariate logistic regression on the dichotomized binary health status showed that people with higher numeracy scores tended to be in better health controlling other covariates. Education and income were positively associated with health status, while age was negatively associated with it. The results were similar to those of the nationwide PIAAC data, except that ethnicity was not associated with health status in PIAAC study. The ESP regression overperformed PIAAC regression with a lower AUC. (b) Though the relationship between numeracy and visits to care providers were not significantly correlated, males and females showed different habits of visiting doctors. There was no association between numeracy and healthcare-provider visits in the female subset of ESP data controlling other covariates. However, the weighted ordinal multinomial regression showed that numeracy was negatively associated with doctor visits for males. Conclusion Higher numeracy is related to better self-reported health status. There is a gender difference in healthcare-providers visits that numeracy plays a role in males but not in the female subgroup.\nFaculty Advisor: Dr. Jessica Ancker\nClient: Dr. Jessica Ancker Team Members: Tianran Zhang, Haojia Li, Zihan Yang\n","date":1594252800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594252800,"objectID":"05f5f2e362b0cea9cda5393087b1af04","permalink":"/project/capstone/","publishdate":"2020-07-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/capstone/","section":"project","summary":"Investigate the association of numeracy scales with self-reported health status and healthcare-provider visits.","tags":["R","ML"],"title":"ESP 2019 Data Analysis","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The World Health Organization has estimated that 12 million deaths occur worldwide every year due to the heart disease. In the United States, cardiovascular diseases are the number 1 cause of death in adults. Early diagnosis is the key to prevent heart related deaths. Potential cardiovascular patients are often sent for multiple tests, and these test results help the doctors to make a diagnosis. The accuracy of the diagnosis often relies on the individual doctor’s knowledge and experiences. In order to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis, a group of medical researchers collected patient data from 4 national hospitals; two in the United States, and two in Europe. The data set HD.xlsx includes the patients age, gender, 11 test results, and ﬁnal diagnosis. The patient data from the two US hospitals and two European hospitals are saved in the 4 tabs, labeled “US1”, “US2”, “EU1”, “EU2”, respectively. The dictionary of all variables is saved in the tab “Dictionary”. Assume that no patient within is correlated with other patients within hospital.\nIn order to ﬁnd the factors that signiﬁcantly contribute to the accuracy of diagnosis, I conducted two approaches sequentially.\na) Detect the presence of CVD: dichotomize the severity variable and consider the presence of narrowing vessel as response variable.\nb) Predict the severity of CVD: build a model with the severity of heart disease as response variable.\nI developed several statistical models including GLM, KNN, SVM, and SDA to use the medical test results to help predict the likelihood of the presence of heart disease as well as its severity. The overall prediction accuracy is 84.78% in detecting the presence of CVD, and 64.1% in detecting the severity of CVD.\nI also took a consideration on the costs of different test, and revise the final model with 6 predictors to balance between cost and effectivceness. The prediction accuracy for the revided model is 80.43% in predicting the presence of CVD, and 53.3% in predicting the severity of CVD.\nTest Cost cp Immediate results, no additional cost thestbps Immediate results, no additional cost chol $7.27, need one day laboratory work fbs $5.20, need one day laboratory work restecg $15.50, need one day laboratory work thalach $102.90, need one day laboratory work exang $87.30, need one day laboratory work oldpeak $87.30, need one day laboratory work slope $87.30, need one day laboratory work ca $100.90, need one day laboratory work thal $102.90, need one day laboratory work ","date":1586649600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586649600,"objectID":"612e4b6a80fecf376db88f247edf7d25","permalink":"/project/heart-diesase/","publishdate":"2020-04-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/heart-diesase/","section":"project","summary":"This is a poster I designed applied and compared several ML methods in predicting CVD.","tags":["R","ML"],"title":"Heart Disease Prediction with ML methods","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"An educational use R package corresponding to Rizzo’s book Statistical Computing with R.\nThis the first R package that I developed.

It has a great use in statistical data visulization. I got in touch with it in the first year of my graduate study and I had so much fun presenting statistical plot with the help of ggplot2! However, there are so many aesthetics and parameter settings in this package, and it is easy to mixed up. ggplot cheatsheet is always ready for help. I decided to summarise the most common used aesthetics of ggplot2 as well as how to make a qualified plot in statistics. Hope you may find this blog useful!\nPractical thins to make a plot better There are 8 criterions one has to meet in order to make a plot better:\n• Label the axis\n• Have a title\n• Make sure the title and axis are large enough\n• Label the plot or have a legend\n• Text on plots is great\n• Use color and fill effectively groups\n• Don’t make a plot overly complex – make two plots\n• Get rid of non-essentials\nCommon used aesthetics Geom • geom_point() • geom_smooth() • geom_boxplot() • geom_bar() • geom_histogram() • geom_density() • geom_linerange() • geom_text() • geom_curve(x = , xend = , y = , yend = , arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, \u0026#39;cm \u0026#39;)), curvature = 0.5) • stat_function() Tips: if the variable is not continues, use bar graphs to display the distribution of categorical variables instead of histogram or density plot.\nTHEME • theme(axis.text = element_text(), axis.tltle = element_text(), plot.title = element_text(), legend.position = , legend.title = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, angle = 90, hjust = 1, face = \u0026#39;bold\u0026#39;) • ylab(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;) • xlab() • ggtitle(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;) GUIDES \u0026amp; LEGEND • guides() • ylim() • coord_trans() • coord_flip() • scale_y_continuous() • scale_y_discrete() • scale_color() Tips: The only difference between coord_trans() and scale_y_continuous() is where the tick marks on the axis are drawn (scale_y_continuous has the tick more evenly)\nFACET • facet_wrap(~, nrow = ) • facet_grid(~, labeller = label_both) COLOR • RColorBrewer library(RColorBrewer)\ndisplay.brewer.all()\ng + scale_fill_brewer(palette = ‘Accent’, ‘Dark2’)\n• wesanderson library(wesanderson)\nag + scale_fill_brewer(‘Zissou1’)\ng + scale_fill_manual(values = wes_palette(n = 3, name = ‘Zissou1’, ‘FantasticFox1’))\nExamples ggplot is so powerful a tool that one can recreate almost any plot with R. Here is an excellent blog post from Rafa Irizarry on how to recreate plots using ggplot2 from blog Simply Statistics.\nOn Data Science class, we recreated a plot from a FiveThirtyEight blog. That interesting experience shows how useful ggplot2 is and I am writing this blog to show how we recreate that plot.\nData wrangling We used the make_babynames_dist() function in the mdsr package to add some more convenient variables to our dataset and to filter for only the data that is relevant to people alive in 2014.\nBabynamesDist \u0026lt;- make_babynames_dist() head(BabynamesDist) We filtered the data so we only have babies with the name Joseph who are male.\njoseph \u0026lt;- BabynamesDist %\u0026gt;% filter(name == \u0026#39;Joseph\u0026#39; \u0026amp; sex == \u0026#39;M\u0026#39;) Data visualization We ploted the number of Joseph’s born each year who are estimated to be alive on January 1, 2014. We will get that estimate by mutiplying the number of Josephs born in a year by the probability that a person from that year will be alive on January 1, 2014. We added the line for the number of Josephs born each year to our plot.\nname_plot \u0026lt;- ggplot(data = joseph) + geom_bar(aes(x = year, y = count_thousands * alive_prob), stat = \u0026#39;identity\u0026#39;, fill = \u0026#39;#b2d7e9\u0026#39;, colour = \u0026#39;white\u0026#39;) + geom_line(aes(x = year, y = count_thousands), lwd = 1) + ylab(\u0026#34;Number of People (thousands)\u0026#34;) + xlab(NULL) + theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \u0026#34;bold\u0026#34;)) name_plot Next we need to add a darker blue bar indicating the median year of birth for a Jospeh alive on January 1, 2014.\nmedian_yob \u0026lt;- with(joseph, wtd.quantile(year, est_alive_today, probs = .5)) name_plot \u0026lt;- name_plot + geom_bar(stat = \u0026#39;identity\u0026#39;, color = \u0026#39;white\u0026#39;, fill = \u0026#39;#008fd5\u0026#39;, aes(x = year, y = if_else(year == median_yob, est_alive_today/1000, 0))) name_plot Finally we updated the axis labels\nname_plot_2 \u0026lt;- name_plot + ggtitle(\u0026#34;Age Distribution of American Boys Joseph\u0026#34;) + geom_text(x = 1940, y = 30, label = \u0026#34;Number of Josephs \\n born each year\u0026#34;) + geom_text(x = 1929, y = 12, label = \u0026#34;Number of Josephs \\n born each year \\n estimated to be alive\u0026#34;, colour = \u0026#34;#b2d7e9\u0026#34;) + geom_text(x = 2003, y = 37, label = \u0026#34;The median \\nliving Joseoph \\n is 37 years old\u0026#34;, colour = \u0026#34;darkgray\u0026#34;)+ geom_curve(x = 1995, xend = 1974, y = 37, yend = 24, arrow = arrow(length = unit(.3, \u0026#34;cm\u0026#34;)), curvature = .5) + ylim(0, 40) + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 22)) name_plot_2 We can also change the name to “Jessie” and the sex to “female”\nname_plot %+% filter(BabynamesDist, name == \u0026#39;Josephine\u0026#39; \u0026amp; sex == \u0026#39;F\u0026#39;) ","date":1572134400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572134400,"objectID":"cad499a131b6cc8caea8d274f312c214","permalink":"/post/ggplot2/ggplot2/","publishdate":"2019-10-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/ggplot2/ggplot2/","section":"post","summary":"ggplot2 is an R package created by Hadley Wickham.

Whenever we code with R to do some complex data analyzing, R packages will always help. It is cool to make one’s R package to share code with others. I learned how to create an R package in the Data Science class and decided to write the procedure in this blog. I Hope it is helpful for you.\nReady to build your R package? Let’s start!\n1. Make a new project in a new directory In RStudio, go to File » New Project. Select to make a new project in a new directory. Select the project type as an R Package.\nName the R Package, select the working directory where the R package will be in, and click ‘Create Package’.\nNow go to the directory and check out what you have!\nYou can see the same thing inside of RStudio:\n2. Write your functions After you have created the package, install, and library these two packages:\nlibrary(devtools) library(roxygen2) Go to File » New File » R Script. In this R Script we will write to create an R file with a function for our package:\n# Sample function diamond_plot \u0026lt;- function(df, varx, vary){ ggplot(df, aes(x=get(varx), y=get(vary))) + geom_point(shape=23, fill=\u0026#34;blue\u0026#34;, color=\u0026#34;darkred\u0026#34;, size=3) } Once we are done writing the function, we will save this R Script as diamond_plot.R in the R folder of our package.\nLet’s take a look at what this function does.\n# Draw sample plot with the function. df.test \u0026lt;- data.frame(x = rnorm(10), y = rnorm(10)) diamond_plot(df.test, \u0026#39;x\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;y\u0026#39;) 3. Add documentation for your package. While you have the script diamond_plot.R open, go to Code » Insert Roxygen Skeleton. Make sure your cursor is inside of the function when you do this.\nNow you can fill in your documentation.\nGo up a level to find the DESCRIPTION file, click on the DESCRIPTION file and edit it.\n4. Add Data to your package Make a data folder.\nSave data in this folder using a .RData object.\n# Sample data sample_data \u0026lt;- data.frame(x = rnorm(10), y = rnorm(10), z = rnorm(10)) save(sample_data, file = \u0026#39;ExamplePackage/data/sample_data.RData\u0026#39;) 5. Install and Check the Packages Run the following code in the same working directory as the package.\ndocument() And then go down one level in the working directory and run the following code.\nsetwd(\u0026#39;..\u0026#39;) install(\u0026#39;ExamplePackage\u0026#39;) 6. Check what you got! Type the following commands in the console, and you can see the documentation of your package.\n?diamond_plot data(sample_data) 7. Upload and share your R Package with others. You can put your package on Github. Make a new repository with the same name as your package, and make it public.\nCongratulations! Now you can create your R package, install the package from the Github or give it to a friend to use with the following code.\ndevtools::install_github(\u0026#39;yourusername/ExamplePackage\u0026#39;) ","date":1572134400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572134400,"objectID":"2b239559abbe6f8c476907dfa345ed31","permalink":"/post/rpackage/rpackage/","publishdate":"2019-10-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/rpackage/rpackage/","section":"post","summary":"R packages are strong tools in R coding.
